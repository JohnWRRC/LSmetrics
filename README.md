# LandScape (LS) Connectivity

This repository is being used to develop and share LS Connectivity software.

LS Connectivity is a software designed to calculate landscape metrics and landscape statistics, as well as generate maps of landscape connectivity.
Also, the software is designed to prepare maps and enviroment for running BioDIM, an individual-based model of animal movement in fragmented landscapes.
The software runs in a GRASS environment and uses raster images as input.

LS Connectivity is being developed at the Spatial Ecology and Conservation Lab, at Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil.
