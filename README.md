LS Connectivity development

LS Connectivity is a software designed to calculate the landscape metrics and landscape statistics and generate maps of landscape connectivity.
Also, the software is also designed to prepare maps and enviroment for running BioDIM, an individual-based model of animal movement in fragmented landscapes.
The software runs in a GRASS environment and uses raster images as input.
